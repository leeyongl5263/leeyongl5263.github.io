        <P> As I was growing up and was immsered in the gaming world, I began to play my first strategy games. They
            started out as simple tower defense and village building titles but as I got my first Laptop,
            phone, and a better access to the internet my games began changing. Soon I was playing games such as Call of
            War, Art of War, Mobile raid(Not the Shadow legends type, a rts that whoese severs were shut down.),
            and War Planet. This year and undistrubed access to a computer, I began gaining access to Blizard and steam
            games such as Starcraft 2 and Order of Battle. Right there and then, I began questioning the point of making
            certain parts of video games
            a pay to win.
